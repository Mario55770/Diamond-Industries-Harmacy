You can use images by changing the image line to the name of the folder here(Currently DiamondShieldTextures/BrickSack would give you my brick sack image)
There are guides on how to make them, but Im providing a couple of textures I used. They arent high quality, but they are free. If you put your pngs in this folder, your file path is created by changing BrickSack to your pngs name.

The format is name of the folder/image name. The image needs to be a png.
