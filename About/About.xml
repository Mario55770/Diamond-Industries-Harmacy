Brought to you by the exclusive Diamond Industries, the harmacy. Featuring poisons, medicines, and more, including antidotes.(note, currently just poisons are implemented)
For legal reasons, Diamond Industry executives require warnings informing users to not load poisons into the slot labeled poison, as that would create a chemical weapon.

Welcome to the Diamond Industry Harmacy Beta Release


Current features
Basic Ideology support.

Poison weilding raiders. Now any pawn belonging to another faction may spawn with poisoned weapons.

Poison melee and ranged weapons. Poison consumed only on a hit. Automatically configured to use all weapons that are implemented correctly(in other words, should be cross mod compatible unless they did something weird)

New gui widget, under the assign tab, pick what poison a pawn should use, and they'll automatically apply it.

Poison is consumed on a hit, make sure to keep stocked up.

Toggle between using poison on a new gizmo. Turn it off for huntiing or fighting mechanoids. Turn it on for battle.

Milk snakes.

Cobras and toxic spikes and fangs have been swapped to use cobra venom and midnight murder respectively.

Three new poisons, Cobra Venom, Brick Knockout, and Midnight Murder.

Cobra Venom is a potent poison which specializes in making everything worse. Causing necrosis in most open wounds, increasing the victims bleed rate, weakening most stats slightly, and rarely causing heart attacks.

Brick Knockout is an anesthetic, which confers primarly pain tolerance and a loss of consciousness. For those well versed in Rimworld...this might be sounding a bit familiar. This assists in capturing pawns.

Midnight Murder is a combat poison through and through. It excels in downing pawns, painfully and dangerously.

Antivenom. Use insect jelly of the toxin immune insectoids, to produce a drug that helps resist being poisoned.


Bug reports require a hugslib at minimum, as well as a description of the problem.

Suggestions for other mods for me to add compatiblity with are welcome.
